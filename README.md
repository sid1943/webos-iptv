# Optimize

M3U player for LG webOS TVs. Playlists are user-provided.

## One-Command Setup (Mac Mini)

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd webos-iptv && ./setup.sh
```

That single command does everything:

1. Installs **Bun**, **Node.js** deps, **webOS CLI tools**
2. Discovers your **LG TV** on the local network (SSDP + port scan)
3. Connects via **WebSocket** and pairs (accept once on TV screen)
4. **Enables Developer Mode** automatically
5. Registers the TV and fetches SSH keys
6. **Builds, packages, and deploys** the app
7. **Launches** the app on the TV

No manual TV menu navigation needed. Just accept the one-time pairing prompt.

### Prerequisites

- **Mac Mini** on the same network as the TV
- **Developer Mode** app installed on the TV (free, from LG Content Store)
- TV must be powered on

### If you know your TV's IP

```bash
./setup.sh 192.168.1.x
```
